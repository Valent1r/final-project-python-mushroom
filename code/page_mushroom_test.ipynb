    "## General guidance for classifying mushrooms from pictures\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Note where the mushroom grows: is it on the ground or on wood.  \n",
    "1.1) If it grows on ground it could be a saprotroph of detritus (karikkeen lahottaja), mycorrhiza (juurisieni) which is specific type of mushroom living from the roots of a tree or it could still be a saprotroph of a tree but the wood is on ground level.  \n",
    "1.2) If it grows on wood consider if it's conifer(havupuu) or hardwood(lehtipuu). Some species grow on only a very specific wood like oak.  \n",
    "2) Do not consider the time of year to be a indicator of any sort. Every year the seasons length differ so one year the mushroom season might start way later than the next year.  \n",
    "3) Underneath the mushroom cap can be different types of gills in various combinations. (TODO)  \n",
    "4) Surface of the cap is also a very good classifier of the mushroom. The structure might not be possible to know from a picture though.  \n",
    "5) Color of the mushroom varies a lot depending on the humidity and the age of the mushroom. When raining the colors get deeper and more distinctive. Young mushrooms have stronger colors than old ones. Also sunlight might diminish the colors.  \n",
    "6) Stipe(jalka) of a mushroom can also indicate a lot of information from the mushroom. Thin and thick shapes are more distinctive than average size.  \n",
    "7) Geographic location of the mushroom could be useful as some species probably don't grow everywhere in Finland.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a lot of data such as smell and touch that could be used but then user would have to input it him or herself.\n",
